# Ciphers
## Purpose
This was an assignment from an Introduction to Java class in 2015. The goal was to create a program that would use a Shuffle and Shift cipher to encode a message input by the user, and then decode it back to the original message.
## How to Run
Simply compile **Encoding.java, ShiftCipher.java, and Shuffle.cipher** and run **Encoding** :)
